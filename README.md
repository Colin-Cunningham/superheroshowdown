# Super Hero Showdown

Picture this, you are sitting down in your living room watching a Marvel movie with your friend. He leans over and says "I bet you Batman could beat Captain America in a fight". Being an intelligent being you shoot up with rage and tell him just how foolish of a statement that is, you go into each of their back stories, bringing up various comic book runs only for him or her to say "prove it". Well this is the app for you, using arbitrary statistics from a superhero API put two comic book characters in a one on one showdown to see who would win.
